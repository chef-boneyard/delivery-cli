Feature: job

Background:
  # `git merge` and `git reset` need to be mocked here because the specific
  # merge and reset commands rely on the existence of an upstream remote
  Given I set the environment variables to:
    | variable             | value      |
    | MERGE_MOCKED         | true       |
    | RESET_MOCKED         | true       |
  And I clean up the ruby env so I can run other ruby bins like ChefDK
  And I am in the "delivery-cli-init" git repo
  And a file named ".delivery/cli.toml" with:
  """
    git_port = "2828"
    pipeline = "master"
